# A Collection Of Small Android App Projects

A collection of very simple Android App projects for a quick lookup or reference.

Current projects:

| Project Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
|NavigationWithBottomNavigationMenuAndOverflowMenu| As the name implies, in this app I set up the navigation controller with the Bottom Navigation Menu and the Overflow Menu. It is a single-activity app with a FragmentContainerView that swaps the fragments in and out. I kept the fragments and their layouts very simple since the most important stuff is done in the MainActivity in this case.|
